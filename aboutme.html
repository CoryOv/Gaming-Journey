    <p>Throughout my life, gaming has been my passion, watching my dad play on the ps1, to receiving my very own ps2 for christmas. My first memories of games I played came from the absolute masterpieces that are Crash Bandicoot ansd Spyro the Dragon. A
        few years ago, remakes of their respective original trilogies were made and my excitement was practically unparalleled.
